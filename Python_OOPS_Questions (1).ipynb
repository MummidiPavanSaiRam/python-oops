        "Python OOPs Questions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style based on the concept of “objects”, which contain both data (attributes) and behavior (methods/functions).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP ?\n",
        "- A class in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines: Attributes (data) , Methods (functions that operate on data)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a real-world instance created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation.\n",
        "-   Abstraction means hiding the internal logic and showing only the important details to the user.\n",
        "It focuses on what an object does, not how it does it.\n",
        "Encapsulation means hiding the internal data of an object and only allowing access through controlled methods.\n",
        "It protects the data and keeps it safe from outside interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python.\n",
        "- dunder methods double underscore methods front and back.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance is the concept of inherting objects from parent class to child class\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "-  Polymorphism means \"many forms\".\n",
        "In Object-Oriented Programming, it refers to the ability of different classes to provide different implementations for the same method name.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python.\n",
        "- Encapsulation is the concept of hiding internal data and only allowing access through methods.\n",
        "It helps protect sensitive information from being changed directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python.\n",
        "- A constructor in Python is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. In Python, the constructor method is named: __init__() (a dunder method).\n",
        "-  In Python, the constructor method is:\n",
        "__init__()\n",
        "It’s called automatically when an object is created.\n",
        "It is a dunder method (short for “double underscore” method).\n",
        "Used to initialize the object with default or passed values.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.  What are class and static methods in Python.\n",
        "- Declared using: @classmethod\n",
        "Takes cls (class itself) as the first argument\n",
        "Declared using: @staticmethod\n",
        "Does not take self or cls\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overloading in Python.\n",
        "- Method Overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different number or types of arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "-  Method Overriding means:\n",
        "A child class provides a new version of a method that already exists in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "-  The @property decorator in Python allows you to define a method that can be accessed like an attribute — without using parentheses ().\n",
        "\n",
        "15. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming because it allows the same method or operation to behave differently depending on the object that calls it.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.  What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be directly instantiated — it only serves as a template for other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the advantages of OOP.\n",
        "- OOP makes code more organized by grouping related data and functions into classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "It allows code reuse through inheritance, so you don’t have to write the same code again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation protects data by hiding it and only allowing access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism lets the same function work in different ways for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable.\n",
        "-  A class variable is shared by all objects of a class, and it has the same value for every object.\n",
        "\n",
        "An instance variable is unique to each object, and its value can be different for each one.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python means that a child class can inherit from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows the child class to access properties and methods from all parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- __str__() is used to return a user-friendly or readable string when you print an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "__repr__() is used to return a developer-friendly string that shows the official representation of the object (often used for debugging).\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python.\n",
        "- The super() function lets the child class access and reuse methods and constructors from its parent class, without writing the parent class name.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python.\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a special method in Python called a destructor.\n",
        "It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed or deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python.\n",
        "- A @staticmethod is a method that does not access the class or instance — it's like a regular function inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "A @classmethod is a method that takes the class (cls) as the first argument and can access or modify class variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance.\n",
        "- Polymorphism with inheritance means that a method in the child class can override the method in the parent class, and the correct version is automatically called based on the object's class.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is method chaining in Python OOP.\n",
        "- Method chaining allows calling multiple methods in a single line by making each method return the same object (self).\n",
        "\n",
        "26. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __call__ method is a special (dunder) method in Python that allows an object to be called like a function."
